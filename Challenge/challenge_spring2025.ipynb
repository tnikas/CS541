In this assignment, your task is to train a model that takes features of a listing as input and predicts the price.\n",

We will train your submitted code on the same provided dataset, and will evaluate it on 2 other test sets (one public, and one hidden during the challenge).\n",

To convert text fields into categorical values, we used different strategies depending on the field. For example, sentiment analysis was applied to convert user reviews to numerical values ('comments' column). We added different columns for state names, '1' indicating the location of the property. Column names are included in the data files and are mostly descriptive.\n",
